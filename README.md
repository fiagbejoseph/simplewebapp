<b>Reasons for Libraries Used</b><br />
JQuery is used for ease, faster and efficient development of the application since it has been tested as components that can be reusable, Also Boostrap was used for designing of the interface. JQuery Ajax was used to handle the Server post and retrival of results after processing. However it was used because of the feature of having to process data from the input field without reloading the webpage, so you check the number of vowels, consonants, characters and words of the same text provided in the input box.
