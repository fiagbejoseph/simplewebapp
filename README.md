<b>Programming Languages Used</b><br/>
This application is developed with PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and can be hosted and accessed on an apache or web server that can run PHP scripts. 
Other languages such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)  is used for the web Elements, Casscading Style Sheets (CSS) is use for styling the Elements and JavaScript (JS) is used for some animation and a bridge to post and retrieve results of processing from Server.

<b>Libraries</b><br />
Boostrap 4.5 : Used for styling the webpage with native CSS<br /> 
JQuery 3.5 : Library with predefined functions and classes built on JavaScript

<b>Interface Note</b><br />
Designed with Boostrap predefined classes like 'card' and used in combination with custom Style Sheet 'mystyle'.

<b>Reasons for Libraries Used</b><br />
JQuery is used for ease, faster and efficient development of the application since they have been tested as components that can be reusable, Also Boostrap is used for designing of the interface. JQuery Ajax is used to handle the Server post and retrival of results after processing. However it was used because of the feature of having to process data from the input field without having to reload the webpage, so you check the number of vowels, consonants, characters and words of the same text provided.
